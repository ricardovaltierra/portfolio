      Besides my career development, I enjoy spending my time on a
      variety of activities and projects, such as reading about topics
      as diverse as pop culture or neuronal and general sciences.
      I like to practice activities like meditation, anaerobic exercise,
      and some long walks.

      Getting immersed into a healthy lifestyle and veganism,
      I spend the rest of my free time exploring new web technologies.

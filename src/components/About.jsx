      Besides my career development, I enjoy spending my time on a
      variety of activities and projects, such as reading about topics
      as diverse as general culture, science, and self-improvement.
      I like to practice some sports like jogging, basketball and
      anaerobic exercise

      movies and television shows, I am an aspiring meditator, and
      I spend the rest of my free time exploring new web technologies

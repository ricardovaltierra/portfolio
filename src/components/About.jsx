      Besides my career development, I enjoy using my time on
      a variety of activities or projects, such as reading
      topics in pop culture, or neuronal and general sciences.
      Other times you can find me knowing the city better. I like
      to practice activities like meditation, anaerobic exercise,
      and some long walks.

      When not on all the above, with family or friends, I&apos;m curiously diving into web tech.
